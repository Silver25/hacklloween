## Introduction

For a real software project, the Introduction section should summarize the motivations for creating the software, the need(s) addressed by the software, what the software does, and optionally, links to resources that can help orient readers. Ideally, this section should be short and use plain language. Keep in mind that not all readers will be familiar with the topic area.

## Installation

Begin this Installation section by describing prerequisites needed to use the software. Examples include required hardware, operating systems, software frameworks, compilers, and/or interpreters.  

Next, provide step-by-step instructions for installing your software, preferably with examples of commands that can be copy-pasted by readers into their computing environments.

## Features

A Features section right after the installation instructions can help readers figure out what’s involved.  What are the main and important parts of the Project, and how to use them.

## Future Features

Introduce users to the plans and features that were not included in MVP [ Minimum Viable Product ] but are considered for future updates.

## Testing

Results of the carried out testing are available here or in another file if the testing was comprehensive.

## Deployment

Here can be described the setup and startup of the Project locally and in the Cloud.

## Technologies and Tools used

## License

This section should state any copyright asserted on the project materials as well as the terms of use for the software, files and other materials found in the project repository.

## Credits [ Acknowledgements ]

This final section is where you should acknowledge funding and/or institutional support, prior work that influenced or inspired your project, resources that you used (such as other people’s software), important contributions from other people, and anything else that deserves mention. After all, nothing is truly done in isolation; everything is built on top of something, and we all owe debts to other projects and people who helped us, supported us, and influenced us.
